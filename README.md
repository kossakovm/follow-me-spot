# Autonomous Human-Following System Using Camera-Based Detection Methods on Boston Dynamics Spot Robot

This repository contains the implementation of an autonomous human-following system for the Boston Dynamics Spot robot using camera-based detection. The system integrates YOLO for human detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and two movement strategies (linear and exponential velocity control) for smooth autonomous following.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `__init__.py` | Initialization file for the Python package. |
| `depth_estimation.py` | Estimates distance to the detected human using bounding box logic. |
| `human_detection.py` | Detects humans using YOLO (version should be specified in code). |
| `human_tracking.py` | Tracks the detected human using DeepSORT. Ensure the DeepSORT model is downloaded before connecting to the robot. |
| `linear.py` | Implements velocity-based following logic. You must configure Spot‚Äôs IP address, username, and password. |
| `exponential.py` | Enhanced version of `linear.py` using exponential (sqrt-shaped) speed control with a GAMMA parameter. Provides smoother acceleration in mid-range distances. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `__pycache__` directories will be created automatically after running scripts.
